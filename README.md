An implementation of the [Nystr√∂mformer: A Nystr√∂m-Based Algorithm for Approximating Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) paper by Xiong et al. The self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token is a key component of the performance of Transformers. This uses the Nystr√∂m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity allowing to exhibit scalability as a function of sequence length.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

```sh
pip install nystromformer
```

## Developing nystromformer

To install `nystromformer`, along with tools you need to develop and test, run the following in your virtualenv:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-dagli/Nystromformer.git
# or clone your own fork

cd Nystromformer
pip install -e .[dev]
```

To run rank and shape tests run the following:

```
pytest -v --disable-warnings --cov
```

## Usage

### Nystrom Attention

```py
import tensorflow as tf
from nystromformer import NystromAttention

attn = NystromAttention(
    dim = 512,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    num_landmarks = 256,    # number of landmarks
    pinv_iterations = 6,    # number of moore-penrose iterations for approximating pinverse. 6 was recommended by the paper
    residual = True         # whether to do an extra residual with the value or not. supposedly faster convergence if turned on
)

x = tf.random.normal((1, 16384, 512))
mask = tf.ones((1, 16384), dtype=tf.bool)

attn(x, mask = mask) # (1, 16384, 512)
```

### Nystromformer

```py
import tensorflow as tf
from nystromformer import Nystromformer

model = Nystromformer(
    dim = 512,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    depth = 6,
    num_landmarks = 256,
    pinv_iterations = 6
)

x = tf.random.normal((1, 16384, 512))
mask = tf.ones((1, 16384), dtype=tf.bool)

model(x, mask = mask) # (1, 16384, 512)
```
